# Andrew Bevan: Scripting the Spatial Analysis of Archaeological Datasets


This repository includes the pdf slides used to illustrate the talk entitled "Scripting the Spatial Analysis of Archaeological Datasets". Also included are the data and R code used to create the results in the slides.

Note that the spatial data used here has already been moved to an arbitrary grid so will not map correctly in absolute space. 

The workflow discusses (a) loading and mapping spatial data in R, (b) repositioning spatial data to avoid passing on perfectly accurate coordinates, but without degrading precision, and (c) construction of relative risk surfaces from case-control data.
